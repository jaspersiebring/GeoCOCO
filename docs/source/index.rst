Easily transform your GIS annotations into `Microsoft's Common Objects In Context (COCO) <https://cocodataset.org/#format-data>`_ datasets with GeoCOCO. This tool allows users to leverage the advanced digitizing solutions of modern GIS software for the annotations of image objects in geographic imagery.

Built with `Pydantic` and `pycocotools`, it features a complete implementation of the COCO standard for object detection with out-of-the-box support for JSON-encoding and RLE compression. The resulting datasets are versioned, easily extendable with new annotations and fully compatible with other data applications that accept the COCO format.
